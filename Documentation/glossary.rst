========

CCS
  Code Composer Studio, an integrated development environment from Texas Instruments that can be
  used to develop code for the MSP430 microcontroller

DAC
  Digital to analogue converter. Converts a digitally-encoded value to an analogue signal

EPD
  Electrophoretic display. Such displays retain the last image driven to them and only require
  power to change the image

FFC
  Flexible flat cable (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Flex_Cable)

Hummingbird Z6
  An evaluation board from Plastic Logic that interfaces between a Plastic Logic small display
  (e.g. Type18) and a host processor board (e.g. Parrot or Parrot + Ruddock2)

Hummingbird Z7
  An evaluation board from Plastic Logic that interfaces between a Plastic Logic bracelet display 
  (e.g. Type19) and a host processor board (e.g. Parrot or Parrot + Ruddock2)

HVPMIC
  High voltage power management IC. A chip that converts a single (typically battery) voltage
  into the various higher voltages required by the display

MSP430
  A low-power microcontroller from Texas Instruments

Parrot board
  An evaluation board from Plastic Logic containing a MSP430 microcontroller

PGM
  A portable graphics file format

PIL
  Python Imaging Library, adds image processing support to Python

PNG
  A graphics file format which uses lossless data compression

Raven board
  An evaluation board from Plastic Logic that interfaces between a Plastic Logic 10.7" display
  (e.g. Type11) and a host processor board (e.g. Parrot or Parrot + Ruddock2)

Ruddock2 board
  An evaluation board from Plastic Logic that interfaces between the Parrot board and one of the
  display interface boards (Raven, Hummingbird Z6/Z7)

S1D13524
  An EPD controller chip from Epson, designed for use with displays up to a resolution of
  4096x4096 pixels. Also supports colour displays

S1D13541
  A combined EPD controller chip and source driver from Epson, designed for use with displays
  up to a resolution of 854x480 pixels

VCOM
  Display-specific common electrode voltage. Each Plastic Logic display is supplied with the correct
  voltage that must be applied by the control electronics

Waveform
  A display-specific datafile that defines how the display updates
