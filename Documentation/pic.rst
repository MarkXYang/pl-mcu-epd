Microchip - PIC
===============

The Microchip PIC is probably the most numerous of microcontrollers. It is available in a wide range of
configurations with numerous peripherals. The Harvard architecture nature of many of the devices is visible
in C source code (data location in ROM or RAM matters) and will require some effort to support.
No port to this platform has been completed yet.

Many of the 8bit PIC microcontrollers have the necessary resources to support the code base.
